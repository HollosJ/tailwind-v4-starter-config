# CSS Config file for Tailwind V4

This is a CSS config file for Tailwind V4 (`global.css`). It is a good starting point for a new project.

## Features

- Tailwind V4 removes the pointer cursor from all buttons by default. This is a good thing, but it can be annoying when you want to use a button as a link. This CSS file re-introduces the pointer cursor for all non-disabled buttons.

- The `container` utility class is centered and has a 1rem padding on either side.

- The `dark` variant is used to style dark mode elements. This now works like the `dark` class in Tailwind V3.
